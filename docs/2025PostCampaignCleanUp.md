# 2025 Post Campaign Clean Up

## New Form Action Composable

Fundraising team wanted to send the donor to different address form depending on the amount,
so we created a new formAction composable
 
Ticket: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T372555

### Files to look at:
- UseAmountBasedFormAction.ts (This is the new composable)
- MultistepDonation.vue (We added a formActionOverride prop for this, it may need to be integrated or removed)
- Take care of the tests
