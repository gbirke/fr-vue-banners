		For a long time the outcome was uncertain, but at the very last we reached our donation goal. That's a real ray
		of sunshine in these critical times, when so much is unstable, and we're questioning much that we thought was
		certain. It's all more than a little unsettling. But there are also things that give us hope. Wikipedia is one
		of them. Wikipedia braves the many storms of our present day: polarization, disinformation, manipulation. It's
		not perfect, but it's solid as a rock.
	</p>

	<p>
		In times like these, Wikipedia is so valuable because it's a place where people of vastly different viewpoints
		still hold conversations -- frequently controversial ones, but ones that stay within the rules.
	</p>

	<p>
		Participants debate content, sources and wording in an open and transparent way. At times all that can be
		tedious, not to mention exhausting. But it's that very process that allows the creation of verified, neutral
		and trustworthy information. Nobody has the power to declare what should be in Wikipedia – neither billionaires
		nor the powers that be. And because it's an independent and collaborative project, it can't be bought up by
		someone and destroyed. That's what Wikipedia stands for – as do we, the charitable organization behind this
		marvelous project.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the pillars of content independence is <strong>financial independence</strong>. Precisely because
		Wikipedia is non-commercial and anybody can use it for free, we depend on the <strong>regular support</strong>
		of dedicated <strong>supporting members</strong> who help protect this one-of-a-kind place of democracy on the
		internet. And yet, given how beloved Wikipedia is across the world, those protectors are still very few and far
		between.
	</p>

	<p>
		That's why we're asking you to <strong>join this community of Wikipedia enthusiasts</strong> and to help us
		handle, among other things, the many current technological challenges we face.
